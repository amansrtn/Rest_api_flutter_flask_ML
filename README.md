The Backend Api Is A Rest Api.
This is made to send data from user to the server.
Here we are sending "N" numbers of data to the server.
Currently this is used for ML Model.
It send data to the backend server where the user input is taken as parameter for the ML model.
After that the ML model predict the output and send the result in the form of JSON to the flutter app
The output can be displayed in the flutter app as an String.
This will Help the developers to fetch large amount of data from the user and take them as an input for their ML Model.
